  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    The Truth Movement was born from real pain, real struggle, and real transformation. We exist to prove that your past doesn’t disqualify you — it prepares you. No matter what you've been through, you can rise, speak your truth, and rewrite your story.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We believe that <strong>God is everything</strong> — in us, around us, and moving through every second chance, every hard conversation, every breakthrough. With faith, grit, and honesty, anyone can change. No one is too far gone.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We stand for redemption. We speak life into those the world gave up on. We guide the next generation away from destruction and toward their purpose — through <strong>education, creativity, community, and raw truth.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This movement isn’t about judgment. It’s about love, respect, and accountability. It’s about owning our past without shame and choosing to grow — for ourselves, our families, and our communities.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is more than an organization. It’s a lifestyle. A calling. A revolution of the heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Our truth. Our time. Our movement.</strong>

            <h2>Our Programs</h2>
            <div class="program">
                <h3>Redemption Academy</h3>
                <p><strong>For people coming home from prison or caught in the street cycle — mentorship, education, job training, and spiritual growth. A real shot at something better.</strong></p>
                <p>Redemption Academy is the heartbeat of the Truth Movement — a transformative program built for those re-entering society after incarceration, overcoming addiction, or breaking out of generational cycles of violence and survival. We don’t believe anyone is too far gone. We believe in redemption. Real redemption — built on truth, accountability, faith, and support.</p>
                <p>This academy isn't just a place, it's a path. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mentorship That Walks With You:</strong> We pair each participant with someone who’s walked the road — mentors who’ve lived through it, changed their lives, and now reach back to help others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education That Builds You:</strong> From GED programs and literacy support to financial literacy and life skills workshops — we teach what the system forgot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Job Training That Equips You:</strong> Hands-on job training through community partnerships — barbering, trades, culinary arts, coding, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spiritual Growth That Grounds You:</strong> Prayer circles, recovery-based spirituality, meditation, and God-centered encouragement — all faiths welcome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability That Elevates You:</strong> Weekly check-ins, peer support, and structured guidance. It’s not a handout — it’s a lifeline with responsibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Redemption Academy is for the ones ready to rise — ready to rebuild their lives, reclaim their future, and rewrite their story. We don't do pity. We do purpose.</p>

  <h3>Young Kings & Queens</h3>
  <p>
    This program is about <strong>reclaiming identity, building confidence, and raising up the next generation of leaders.</strong><br><br>
    We work with youth who are often overlooked — the ones labeled “at risk” — and remind them they are royalty. Through mentorship, we introduce discipline and structure in a way that feels empowering, not controlling.
    <br><br>
    From <strong>sports that teach teamwork and resilience</strong>, to <strong>music that becomes an outlet for expression</strong>, to <strong>entrepreneurship that opens doors beyond the streets</strong> — we provide real tools and real love.
    <br><br>
    We host workshops on leadership, finance, creative arts, and emotional intelligence, while making space for each young person to explore their gifts, tell their story, and know their worth.
    <br><br>
    <em>It’s not just about staying out of trouble — it’s about stepping into purpose.</em>
  </p>
</div>
           <div class="program">
  <h3>Sober & Free Network</h3>
  <p>
    This is more than just staying clean — it's about building a new life.<br><br>
    The Sober & Free Network connects people in recovery with the resources, relationships, and routines that keep them moving forward. We partner with and support <strong>12-step fellowships</strong> like <strong>A.A. (Alcoholics Anonymous)</strong>, <strong>N.A. (Narcotics Anonymous)</strong>, and <strong>Celebrate Recovery</strong>, helping individuals find strength through shared stories and spiritual growth.
    <br><br>
    We guide people toward real help through recovery programs like <strong>ARC (Addiction Recovery Care)</strong> and <strong>Grateful Life Center</strong>, and we uplift <strong>transitional sober living</strong> environments such as <strong>Oxford House</strong> and <strong>Transitions</strong>.
    <br><br>
    This network is built by people who’ve been there — who know that sobriety isn’t just about not using, it’s about finding <strong>community, purpose, and healing</strong>.
    <br><br>
    <em>You don’t have to do this alone. We walk it with you.</em>
  </p>
</div>
        <div class="program">
  <h3>Bars & Books</h3>
  <p>
    Where creativity meets healing.<br><br>
    This program blends <strong>music, poetry, writing, and education</strong> into a safe space where people can tell their truth and take back their voice. Whether it’s writing bars in the studio, journaling painful experiences, or reading a book that shifts your mindset — this is about <strong>expression that leads to transformation</strong>.
    <br><br>
    We hold workshops, freestyle circles, journaling groups, and reading clubs that help people process trauma, speak hope, and stay out the streets by giving them something powerful to say.
    <br><br>
    <em>Rap your story. Write your future. Read your healing.</em>

  <h2>What We Believe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>✔ Everyone can change — no matter your past.</strong><br>
      We don’t care where you’ve been — prison, addiction, mistakes, the bottom. We’ve been there too. What matters is where you’re willing to go from here. Change is possible when truth is embraced.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>✔ God is everything — many names, same source.</strong><br>
      Whether you call Him God, Allah, Creator, or just “something bigger,” we know there’s a Power greater than us that’s been pulling us through. We honor that Power in all its forms, and let it guide us.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>✔ Hard work beats talent when talent won’t work.</strong><br>
      You might not have all the resources — but if you’ve got hustle, faith, and a refusal to quit, you’ve got enough. We don’t wait for perfect. We grind through the pain with purpose.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>✔ Lift as we climb — bring others with us.</strong><br>
      This ain’t a solo mission. We rise by pulling others up. When we heal, we help. When we level up, we teach. When we shine, we light the path for someone else. This is community. This is movement.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

    <section id="involved" class="involved">
  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <p>
    This ain't just a movement — it’s a mission. And missions need people who’ve been through it, felt it, and are ready to turn their pain into purpose. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to care.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Mentor someone</strong> who's been through the same trenches you made it out of. Share your scars, not your shame. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Volunteer your time</strong> — at events, programs, or just being present. A few hours of love can shift someone’s whole direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Donate</strong> to help us expand programs, offer scholarships, and support folks re-entering life after addiction, prison, or trauma.
  </p>

  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Join us</strong> — show up, speak out, use your gifts. Whether it's art, teaching, music, business, or just being that one real voice in the room… we need you.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s someone out there waiting for your exact story, your wisdom, your breakthrough. This is your shot to be that bridge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because the movement ain’t just about changing lives — it’s about saving them.
